## Exceptions

Current theme of our tasks is Exceptions.
### Declaring exceptions:

First task is filling exceptions with code.
<br>
You have to make exceptions in two classes: 
ru.danka.exceptions.InternalException (must have constructor with message, and getter) <br>
ru.danka.exceptions.InteractException (extends Exception)


### Working with exceptions
You need to fill class ru.danka.exceptions.checker.StringChecker with your code to throw necessary exceptions.
